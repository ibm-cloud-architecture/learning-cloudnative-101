These processes are valuable and ensures that the software is up to date timely.\n\n- **Continuous Integration** is an automation process which allows developers to integrate their work into a repository. When a developer pushes his work into the source code repository, it ensures that the software continues to work properly. It helps to enable collaborative development across the teams and also helps to identify the integration bugs sooner.\n- **Continuous Delivery** comes after Continuous Integration. It prepares the code for release. It automates the steps that are needed to deploy a build.\n- **Continuous Deployment** is the final step which succeeds Continuous Delivery. It automatically deploys the code whenever a code change is done. Entire process of deployment is automated.\n\n## Resources\n\n<CardGroup>\n<MiniCard title=\"Tekton Overview\" href=\"/slides/04-Tekton-Overview.pdf\">\n</MiniCard>\n<MiniCard title=\"IBM Cloud DevOps with Tekton\" href=\"/slides/10-IBM-Cloud-DevOps.pdf\">\n</MiniCard>\n</CardGroup>\n\n## Activities\n\nThe continuous integration activities focus around Tekton the integration platform.
