Provisioning a LogDNA instance from the catalog\">\nTo provision an instance of LogDNA from the IBM Catalog catalog, complete the following steps:\n\n1. [Log in to the IBM Cloud console](https://cloud.ibm.com/login)\n\n1. Click **Catalog**. The list of the services that are available on IBM Catalog opens.\n\n1. To filter the list of services that is displayed, select the **Developer Tools** category.\n\n1. Click the **IBM Cloud Log Analysis with LogDNA** tile.\n\n1. Select the region. \n\n1. Select a service plan. By default, the **Lite** plan is set.\n\n    For more information about the service plans, see [Service plans](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Monitoring-with-Sysdig-pricing_plans#pricing_plans).\n\n1. Enter a service name.\n\n1. Select a resource group. By default, the **Default** resource group is set.\n\n1. Click **Create**.\n\nAfter you provision an instance, \n\n* The *Observability* dashboard opens. \n* A service ID is automatically created. You can use this service ID to get the LogDNA access key for your instance. \n\nNext, configure a metric source by adding a LogDNA agent. This agent is responsible for collecting and forwarding logs to LogDNA. \n  </AccordionItem>\n</Accordion>\n\n<Accordion>\n  <AccordionItem title=\"2. Create minikube cluster\">\n\n1.
