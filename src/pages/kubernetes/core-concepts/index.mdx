# Kubernetes API Primitives

Kubernetes API primitive, also known as Kubernetes objects, are the basic building blocks of any application running in Kubernetes

Examples:
- Pod
- Node
- Service
- ServiceAccount

Two primary members
- Spec, desired state
- Status, current state

# Creating Pods
A Pod is the basic execution unit of a Kubernetes application–the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. A Pod represents processes running on your Cluster.

A Pod encapsulates an application’s container (or, in some cases, multiple containers), storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run. A Pod represents a unit of deployment: a single instance of an application in Kubernetes, which might consist of either a single container or a small number of containers that are tightly coupled and that share resources.

# Projects/Namespaces

Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects.

Namespaces provide a scope for names. Names of resources need to be unique within a namespace, but not across namespaces.

Namespaces are a way to divide cluster resources between multiple users (via resource quota).

It is not necessary to use multiple namespaces just to separate slightly different resources, such as different versions of the same software: use labels to distinguish resources within the same namespace. In practice namespaces are used to deploy different versions based on stages of the CICD pipeline (dev, test, stage, prod)
