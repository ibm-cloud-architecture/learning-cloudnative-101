== Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about how to use docker and how to run applications using docker.

== Prerequisites

- You need https://www.java.com/en/[Java] installed on your environment. You can download it https://www.java.com/download/[here]. Please install the latest version which is Java Version 8. Make sure you set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. You can verify the version after installation using `java -version`.
- Create a https://hub.docker.com/[DockerHub account]. This account is needed to push images to docker registry. Also create a repository following the instructions https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/[here].
- You need to install https://www.docker.com/[Docker] in your environment. Follow the instructions https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/[here] to install it on Mac and https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/[here] to install it on Windows.

== IBM Cloud Login

Start by opening a web browser and navigating to https://cloud.ibm.com/[IBM Cloud].

Next *_login_* with your IBM Cloud login you created.  After login you will be navigated to your *Cloud Dashboard*.

image::IBM_Cloud_Dashboard.png[]

On the *Cloud Dashboard* in the resource summary section, select *Open Shift Clusters*.

image::CL_Dash_Kube.png[]

In cluster list, select the cluster you would like to access. Make sure the cluster you select has a red circle openshift icon next to it.

== Accessing the Open Shift Cluster

Once on the *Overview* screen of your Open Shift cluster, select the *Connect via CLI* in the upper right hand corner.

image::OS-Connect.png[]

From this screen there are two options. One is using the *OpenShift Console* and the other is to use the *CLI via the oauth token request page*
Once logged in to either the *OpenShift Console* or *CLI* we need to get the sample application.

== Getting the Sample Application

Download the sample application from Github: https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudnative_sample_app/tree/Basic-Tutorial[Sample App]

== Deploying the Sample Application
In this section we will deploy the sample application that you downloaded. You can follow the *Console* section to deploy it via the *OpenShift Console* and the *CLI* section for the command line.

=== Via Console

With the OpenShift Console open, let's *Create a Project* named *deploy-sample*

==== Create Project

In the upper-right corner _click_ on *Create Project*

image::os-console-create.png[]

Next, fill in the name section with *deploy-sample* and _click_ *Create*

image::project-details.png[]

You will see that a new project was created in the list. _Click_ on the *Project Name*(deploy-sample).

Now you will see the project screen and it's time to add the *deployment* and *service*.

==== Create Deployment & Service

In *Finder* or *File Explorer* navigate to the *chart/cloudnativesampleapp* directory of the sample application.

Once there you will see two files: *deployment.yaml* and *service.yaml*

Move back to the Openshift console and find *Add to Project* in the upper-right corner.  _Click_ it and select *Import YAML/JSON*.

image::importYAML.png[]

Next an import screen will open and we need to pull up the *Finder* or *File Explorer* window with the *deployment.yaml* and *service.yaml* files.

_Drag and Drop_ the *deployment.yaml* file first.

image::deployment.png[]

_Click_ *Create* and *Close* and you will see a new *greetings* deployment in the console.

image::newDeployment.png[]

For *Creating a Service* we are going to repeat the steps of *importing a YAML* just like a deployment, but instead of the *deployment.yaml* we will _Drag and Drop_ the *service.yaml*.

image::service.png[]

After Creating the Service let's navigate to the *Services* page to view it.

image::services-page.png[]

On this page you can see your new service named *greeting-service*. You can click on the service to view details about it.

image::newService.png[]

==== Create a Route

Now we need to *Create a Route* for our new service to be reach by users outside of the cluster.

On the service details page, find the *Create Route* button and _Click it_.

image::createRoute.png[]

This will open a form with values prepopulated for *Creating a Route*. No need to change any values so go ahead and _Click_ *Create*.

image::serviceRoute.png[]

A new route has now been created allowing us to access it from the internet. You can see the *Route's Hostname*. That's the new address for your service and we want to _Copy_ it.

Next, _Open a New Tab_ in your web browser and _paste_ the copied address in the search bar.  *BEFORE pressing enter* append */greeting?name=John* to the end of the address.  Then _Press Enter_

You should see the following:

Congrats! That's you have successfully deployed an application on OpenShift.

=== Via CLI

Next open up a *Terminal* window and follow the steps from the *Accessing the OpenShift Cluster* for the CLI access. (Make sure to append "--sso" after "login" if needed).

Once logged in, we want to create a new project called deploy-sample in your OpenShift Cluster:

.Create A Project

[source, bash]
----
$ oc new-project deploy-sample
----

After we have created the project we need to create a deployment of our application.  Navigate to the *chart/cloudnativesampleapp* directory of the sample application.

Once there you will see two files: *deployment.yaml* and *service.yaml*

In next few steps we will deploy each of them. We will start with creating the deployment:

.Create A Deployment

[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f deployment.yaml
----

To verify your deployment is created:

.Verify Deployment

[source, bash]
----
$ oc get deployment
----

Next, we will create the service:

.Create A Service

[source, bash]
----
$ oc create -f service.yaml
----

To verify your service is created:

.Verify Service

[source, bash]
----
$ oc get svc
----

With everything deployed, we next need to expose the service outside the cluster. To do this we need to *create a route*

.Create a Route

[source, bash]
----
$ oc expose svc greeting-service
----

This creates a route connecting the application to users outside of the cluster.  Now that we have a route created we can access the application from a web browser.

To get the created route run:

.Retrieve the Route

[source, bash]
----
$ oc get route
----

Find the route named *greeting-service* and copy the HOST/PORT. Should start with *greeting-service-deploy-sample*

image::get-route.png[]

Next Open a web browser and paste address in the search bar and append */greeting?name=John* to the end of it and hit Enter. You should see the following:

Congrats! That's you have successfully deployed an application on OpenShift.

== Conclusion
